# Compartmental modeling of an epidemic : SIR models (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)
#### Project status: in progress ‚è≥


This project is largely inspired by the "Compartmental Modeling" course I took during my MSc. program, which was originally implemented in R. Here, I revisit the key steps and implement them using Python.

Epidemic simulation and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) modeling : simple SIR, SIR with vaccination, and stochastic SIR.
